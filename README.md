## Design

### Colour Scheme

As the theme of the game is the tv-show Rick and Morty, I tried to use the colors that tipically appear on the show. I used the images of Rick and Morty to be able to create a palette. 

Bistre, Maize and Amaranth Pink fits perfectly with the background image and gives a vibe of the actual tv-show.

### Typography

Google Fonts was used to import the following fonts:

![Boogaloo Font](docs/font-boogaloo.png)

* The font Boogaloo was used for the titles and the majority of content. I think it has a playful appearance and fits perfectly with the theme of the game.

![Open Sans Font](docs/font-open-sans.png)

* The font Open Sans was used mainly in the instructions section. I think the font gives the site balance.

### Imagery

As the site has a specific theme, I used images from the Rick and Morty tv-show. I chose a background that displays the characters in the shows and for the flipcards I chose to have different characters.
