## Design

### Colour Scheme

As the theme of the game is the tv-show Rick and Morty, I tried to use the colors that tipically appear on the show. I used the images of Rick and Morty to be able to create a palette. 

Bistre, Maize and Amaranth Pink fits perfectly with the background image and gives a vibe of the actual tv-show.
